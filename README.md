# R-Final-Project
Data Analytics Final Project
We have 4 weeks: Average 1 phase per week

## Phase 1: Proposal: Dataset and Topic Selection
	
**One Page Paper with the following:**

	   Dataset and topic: Craigslist cars trucks data:
        -> Choose a Title, a detailed description, and the specification of the chosen dataset
-> Prepare and clean the dataset so that you can answer question with the dataset
-> Questions and Goals: 
	-> At least 5 questions
	-> What you are going to do to meet your goals and to answer questions?
	-> What visualization may help you seek results?
     		-> Question Ideas (at least 5):

          		During which time of the day is a vehicle most likely to be posted on Craiglist by state?

         		 What is the distribution of manufacturers for each region on Craigslist?

         		 Which Manufacturer is most likely to be published at a price of 0?

         		 What is the relationship of mileage to price for each car model?

        		 What is the relationship between title and price?

		  	 What visualization might help you to get the seek results?
     
Preparing and cleaning data

## Phase 2: Analysis and Modeling: Convince Zakariya Qawaqneh we can finish project using graphs

     Have zip file containing:

     Data set

     R code of plots

     A typed page(Not R markdown?) what we have done, what we still have to do, and description of initial results/outcomes

## Phase 3: Final Results: Use R Markdown (How do we want to share this file?)

     Project report: 1000-1500 lines in R Markdown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNS7i2m4sB0

     Discuss in detail your project steps for getting the final outcomes

     a detailed description about the used dataset and where you got the dataset

     the process followed to clean up the data

     the different solutions you applied to draw the final results

      the machine learning patterns used and your outcomes

     Full discussion about these topics:

     Abstract

     Introduction

     Initial goals

     Dataset

     Data Analysis and Modeling

     Final outcomes and Analysis


## Phase 4: Presentation.

     10 Minutes enforced (Google slides?, Alternate speaking every other slide?)


     Submission: Submit zip file with the following in it:

     Dataset

     Code of project (R code)

     Project report 

     (Not typed page?)


     Questions for Zakariya Qawaqneh:

     Phase 2 typed page: Do we use R markdown? If not do we include it in the submission zip?
