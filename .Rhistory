# What is the relationship between odometer and price?
#regression analysis
ggplot (cars_edited, aes( x =odometer, y=price_usd)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth()
#Correlation
cor(cars_edited$odometer, cars_edited$price_usd)
odometer_on_price <- lm (price_usd ~ odometer, data = cars_edited)
#The estimated regression line equation can be written as
#price_usd = 6493.05 + 8.569*odometer
#The Intercept (b0) is 6493.05.  It can be interpreted as the predicted price in usd for an up counter of 0.  This means that if there are no up counters used, the average sales price would be around $6493.05.
#The regression beta coefficient for the variable odometer (b1) is 8.569.  For an odometer value of 100, Average sales price would be 6493.05+8.569*100, $7349.95, and increase of $857.00.
